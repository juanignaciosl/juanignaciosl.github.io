There's been a hiatus in my activity because my second daughter was born in September :) It's being a tough but beautiful ride :)

Now, I want to get back!

# Podcast

- [Nada que ganar](https://open.spotify.com/show/4IG6LwlGCOWtjf9GJJeoBK?si=27a0c9e9d8f64ecf). I just realized that I
haven't linked this podcast yet! I've been listening them from the very beginning. It's fun and an infinite stream
of books to read.
