I often think that we don't choose our tools profesionally enough. It's true that not all tools are good for every task, and
there's some value in "pick the best tool for each task" motto, but it often looks like we choose driven by trends or
fancy blogposts instead of having proper, solid arguments and knowledge.

In 2016 I was invited to discuss about this with a talk at [CAS 2016, Vitoria](https://cas2016.agile-spain.org/),
and then I repeated with an extended version at [Cylicon Valley](https://cyliconvalley.es/2016/12/06/herramientas-adecuadas-katas-y-principios-y-valores-agiles/).

Disclaimer: this is really biased and many (or all) of my statements are actually open to discussion. But that was the
goal of the talk: discussing!

_And I'm afraid that it's in Spanish._
