excerpt: |
    Hic sunt dracones ("Here be dragons", in English) refers to medieval mapping. Mythological, terrifying creatures were placed un uncharted
    areas. That's my current status: I'm getting out of maps, and going into unexplored territories.

I joined CartoDB (now CARTO) in 2014. There, I learnt about web mapping, raster tiles, vector tiles, PostGIS, geospatial
data, database optimization, mapping frameworks... A whole new world, full of smart, talented
people at all levels, from software developers to cartographers. For me, coming from consultancy firms and
public sector, it was a life-changing job. I will never be grateful enough for those 5 years.

Thanks to all that I learnt there, I was recruited by Tierra. They were building an analytical tool, and they had
geospatial challenges. Those were some of my happiest years, and [shutting it down is one of my saddest memories]({% post_url 2021-10-17-Sit_tibi_terra_levis_Tierra %}),
but I'm glad of keeping good friends ‚ù§.

After Tierra, I joined Felt with a d√©j√† vu feeling. It was like going back to the coffee shop where I was interviewed by Saleiva
and Javier de la Torre 8 years ago, talking about "democratizing map creation on the Internet". Same mission, different
decade, context, tools, and people. I brought something to the table (MVTs! PostGIS! Respect about complicated infrastructure!)
and I also learnt a ton (Tippecanoe! Lambda! Step functions!). The d√©j√† vu also came with some fun challenges.
Paul Ramsey expresses one of them it better than me:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Will be very interesting to see if Felt, having apparently decided that Carto gave up on mass-market map-making too soon, ends up making a pivot to the enterprise in the end, or proves their hypothesis. <a href="https://t.co/HnUyIjfL5j">https://t.co/HnUyIjfL5j</a></p>&mdash; Paul Ramsey (@pwramsey) <a href="https://twitter.com/pwramsey/status/1618683753282547713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I really hope that Felt succeeds. It's a group of exceptional engineers that are delivering at an incredible pace.
Geocoding and geomatching were recently released, getting close to feature parity with the must-have tools for
mass-market maps that CartoDB had when I joined. I've heard many people missing CartoDB at that stage, and Felt is definitely easier and funnier to use.
I'm going on a ["Jane Jacobs walk"](http://www.janejacobswalk.org/) soon with a reading group from [my favourite library](https://www.laotralibreriacafe.net/),
and when I built this map in front of them, even faster than them on paper, they were truly impressed:

<iframe width="100%" height="450" frameborder="0" title="Felt Map" src="https://felt.com/embed/map/La-Otra-Valladolid-con-los-ojos-de-de-Jane-Jacobs-desde-San-Juan-a-Pajarillos-g5ZBhuwoTECRuPzt0ZTTmC?lat=41.649212&lon=-4.717661&zoom=15"></iframe>

Yes, it's not the map that will be featured at [NACIS](https://nacis.org/) keynote or at [R√°fagas](https://geoinquiets.github.io/rafagas/),
but it covers the need of building shareable maps easily and collaboratively. And, of course, you can do [actually impressive, data-oriented maps](https://felt.com/map/US-Energy-Mmk3P8WJR4Czk8CskFVYAA).

I joined Felt as an Individual Contributor. For most of my career, I've had mixed roles that can be defined as "coding and managing". From
large junior teams in consultancy firms to smaller, extremely senior ones in product startups. At Felt, I missed the management
side of things since day one, and now I'm _all in_.

I'm getting out of maps and diving into an unexplored territory.

**I'm starting a new position as an Engineering Manager.**

Being unexplored territory is not accurate, though. If you see [what an Engineer Manager is](https://www.rubick.com/engineering-manager-vs-tech-lead), I tick
all boxes. At CARTO, I became a Tech Lead of a team of 8 senior engineers, and that's essentially a full time job. And
at Tierra, my job ended up being 80% management, 20% SQL optimization. Now, I'm just getting the title and dropping
most of the coding part. Alrocar recently nailed what I'm going to feel (translation: "switching from IC to manager").

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Cuando pasas de IC a manager <a href="https://t.co/pNjEsSQw5k">pic.twitter.com/pNjEsSQw5k</a></p>&mdash; alrocar ü•ò (@alrocar) <a href="https://twitter.com/alrocar/status/1619974573423996929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I wanted to share this because it's an exciting moment ü§ó. I'm more than open to advise, ideas, hints, or whatever you
think can help me. Many authors talk about joining a "manager cabal" to learn and share. Let me know if there's one
around üôáüèª.

I'll miss you, Felt folks ‚ù§. Wish me luck!
