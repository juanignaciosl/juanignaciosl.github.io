Last week Picnic Code people invited us to do a workshop about [CartoDB](https://www.cartodb.com), and we were more than happy about it!

For two hours (!) we demoed map creation and new location analytics tools such as [Deep Insights](https://cartodb.com/deep-insights/).

Here' [the slides](https://juanignaciosl.github.io/cartodb-picniccode16-slides/#/intro):
