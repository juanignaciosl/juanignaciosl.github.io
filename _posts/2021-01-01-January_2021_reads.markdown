I'm beginning a monthly post with content (articles, books, podcast episodes) that I enjoyed. Here we go!

# PostgreSQL

- [CrunchyData learning portal](https://learn.crunchydata.com/).
- [The Surprising Impact of Medium-Size Texts on PostgreSQL Performance](https://hakibenita.com/sql-medium-text-performance).
- [Lessons learned scaling PostgreSQL database to 1.2bn records/month](https://gajus.medium.com/lessons-learned-scaling-postgresql-database-to-1-2bn-records-month-edc5449b3067). This led me to experiment with `from_collapse_limit` and `join_collapse_limit` parameters, because our SQL queries are quite complex and the plan time vs. execution time trade-off should pay off.
- [SQL Optimizations in PostgreSQL: IN vs EXISTS vs ANY/ALL vs JOIN](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/04/16/sql-optimizations-in-postgresql-in-vs-exists-vs-any-all-vs-join/).

# PostGIS

- [PostGIS Trajectory: Space plus Time](https://blog.rustprooflabs.com/2020/11/postgis-trajectory-intro). We're probably going to experiment with routing, this can be priceless.
