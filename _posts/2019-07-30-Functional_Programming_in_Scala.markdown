6 years ago I took the magnificent courses "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" and "Principles of Reactive
Programming", both at Coursera. Now, there's a full 5-course certification,
[Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala),
including topics such as parallel programming or Big Data analysis with Spark, and it was a good moment for a refresher!

These are my notes.

# Courses

## Functional Programming Principles in Scala

This course hasn't changed too much. In fact, Coursera even displays some of the lecture videos as already seen :-).

### Week 6 - Other collections

Weeks 1-5 are pretty much the same content than before. Week 6 dives deeper into collections (which [have been
revamped](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/02/28/collections-rework.html)), so some notes are useful to me:

- Vector: more balanced access patterns than `List`. Implemented with a tree with 32 elements in the nodes, so
random access complexity is `log32(N)` (grows very slowly). 32 is convenient for current processors cache, making
processing in batches very efficient.

## Functional Program Design in Scala

### Week 4 - Functional Reactive Programming

Ways to address concurrent access to global state:
- Synchronization. Cons:
  - it blocks threads
  - can be slow
  - can lead to deadlocks
  - imperative
- Replace global state with thread-local state (`scala.util.DynamicVariable`). Each thread accesses a separate copy. Cons:
  - imperative
  - implemented with a global hash table lookup (potential performance issue)
  - when the threads are multiplexed between tasks it won't work (as a worker can be moved among threads)
- Implicit parameter, value passed to the function. Cons:
  - Requires more boilerplate.
