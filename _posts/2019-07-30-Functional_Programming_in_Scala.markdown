6 years ago I took the magnificent courses "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" and "Principles of Reactive
Programming", both at Coursera. Now, there's a full 5-course certification,
[Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala),
including topics such as parallel programming or Big Data analysis with Spark, and it was a good moment for a refresher!

These are my notes.

# Functional Programming Principles in Scala

This course hasn't changed too much. In fact, Coursera even displays some of the lecture videos as already seen :-).

## Week 6 - Other collections

Weeks 1-5 are pretty much the same content than before. Week 6 dives deeper into collections (which [have been
revamped](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2017/02/28/collections-rework.html)), so some notes are useful to me:

- Vector: more balanced access patterns than `List`. Implemented with a tree with 32 elements in the nodes, so
random access complexity is `log32(N)` (grows very slowly). 32 is convenient for current processors cache, making
processing in batches very efficient.
