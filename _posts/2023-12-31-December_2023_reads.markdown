December 2023 journal, another tough month with little room for many stuff.

# 2023 Wrap-up
I wrote down too many 2023 goals and most of them vanished in a couple of months. By 2023W10 I stopped tracking, with family and work as the main and almost only focus. I didn't met my reading goals (first time since 2016), I didn't cook enough, I didn't play enough (I didn't finish the Tomb of Annihilation campaign nor started a Vampire one, and barely played any videogame), I stopped meditation, I stopped a novel that was too challenging and barely started another one, Pocket just keeps growing, almost made no post beyond the journal... Not a great year. But I'm happy about my family, with Lara and Mia growing like crazy (Mia started walking before her 11th month, that's demanding, and Lara is a funny, happy girl that loves drawing, playing...). And it's been a year of learning a lot about large companies and being an Engineering Manager. I like being an EM.

But there's also been some personal achievements. I won [a writing contest](https://twitter.com/IgnacioCSierra/status/1630840916390084610), I got a decent result in another one, attended many concerts and even a festival, LechazoConf 2024 was announced and started, played a little some board games (mostly with my daughter). Looking forward to a great 2024 :)

# Software Engineering

I sometimes quote Santana about decisions that go beyond just software, and his 2023 favorites won't let you down: [Recortes del 2023 - Javi Santana](https://javisantana.substack.com/p/recortes-del-2023).

## Engineering Management
One of the best engineers at my team, a junior one, said in a Friday feedback form that he was going through an impostor syndrome time. Beyond going through his achievements and suggesting a brag document, [How to Help Someone with Imposter Syndrome](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-help-someone-with-imposter-syndrome) helped me with some new advice, one of them being a new question in my 1:1 agenda: tell me something you did and liked or felt proud of since the last one.

Being an EM is tough, sometimes a rollercoaster of emotions and energy. [This article](https://zaidesanton.substack.com/p/why-managers-have-more-bad-days) (I don't want the clickbaitish title to mislead you) really resonates. I don't buy some of the suggestions, though. If there's no energy, the Mr. Wonderfulish advice of "Going all-in (...) daily-meeting-code-lunch-meeting-1:1-meeting-meeting-debug-meeting and BOOM, itâ€™s the end of the day" seems a recipe for disaster. I would suggest instead taking a step back, reprioritizing, and focusing on the important. [From individual contributor to engineering manager: why engineering management is a hard job](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-manager-p3) is also relevant on this topic of the downsides of management. Annd [Transitioning to manager: The blast radius of bad management](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-manager-p4), too. An interesting topic ðŸ˜…. After going through the dark side, you might need to understand why some of us still like it: [So you want to be a manager - Part 5: Why itâ€™s worth every step](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/so-you-want-to-be-a-manager-p5).

Regular entry about a topic that can't be stressed enough: [Burnout in Tech - understand the symptoms, the costs and fight against burnout](https://www.thecaringtechie.com/p/burnout-in-tech-part-1-declaring).

[Bricks of Love: create purpose and engagement with weekly updates](https://world.hey.com/joaoqalves/bricks-of-love-create-purpose-and-engagement-with-weekly-updates-4a91aa61) shares some ideas that I've recently implemented in my team, a weekly form for feedback and engagement that is then part of the next retrospective as well.
## Startups
[The 2023 SaaS Fundraising Napkin - by CJ Gustafson](https://www.mostlymetrics.com/p/the-2023-saas-fundraising-napkin) gives some perspective on what VC investors think about the path for a SaaS. Many of us still find it hard to understand that you could consider 5-30 customers to be a good enough goal for Series A.
# Music

[My scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/juanignaciosl/library/artists?from=2023-12-01&rangetype=1month) this month are led by VVV, mostly because I attended a concert (it was a mental reset for me just before my vacation time), followed by most of my personal favourites (Planetas, Punsetes, TAB).

# Reads
I read [Beltenebros](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/830545.Beltenebros), a great noir novel by MuÃ±oz Molina, and Lord of the Flies, a classic.
