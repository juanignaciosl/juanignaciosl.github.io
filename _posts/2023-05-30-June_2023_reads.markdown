# Software Engineering

## Engineering management

Although I already reviewed [An Elegant Puzzle](https://juanignaciosl.github.io/learning/2022/12/07/An_elegant_puzzle.html), this post does a better communication job :) [10 Ideas From the Best Book on Engineering Management \| by Syed Mohsin \| Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/10-ideas-from-the-best-book-on-engineering-management-c3caa706f77c).

I'm currently being challenged (and challenging) Scrum processes, and I found these two articles by Mike Cohn quite interesting, in order to relax rules to allow agility despite Scrum: [The Definition of Ready and Its Dangers](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-dangers-of-a-definition-of-ready), [Why Overlapping Work & Concurrent Engineering Are Key to Agility](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-importance-of-overlapping-work-in-agile).

[#134 - A Developer-Centric Approach to Measuring and Improving Productivity - Margaret-Anne Storey & Abi Noda - Tech Lead Journal](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0Kfl4uHODruLrj13sxKPMu?si=Tr41rTkoRMynxMOxypkWhA) is an interesting podcast on the complex topic of productivity metrics. The related paper, [DevEx: What Actually Drives Productivity - ACM Queue](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878), is worth a read.

# Games

I haven't been able to play videogames at all, but I spent a weekend with some friends and enjoyed some board games. While we played several of them, I picked two fillers: [Fantasma Blitz](https://www.amazon.es/Devir-Fantasma-Blitz-juego-BGBLITZ/dp/B007XDQIOO) and [Paku Paku](https://www.amazon.es/Ravensburger-26726-paku/dp/B01N6WOU3Y) :)

# Music

[Another month driven by concerts](https://www.last.fm/user/juanignaciosl/library/artists?from=2023-06-01&to=2023-07-31)! I attended [Veral](https://www.colectivolaika.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Cartel_Veral_2023_1.jpg) (❤️), which increased the scrobbles count of Los Punsetes and Menta (great live gigs!), and Conexión Valladolid. From this one, the band I wanted to see the most was [Miniño](https://www.last.fm/music/Mini%C3%B1o), but the surprise of the festival were [Johnny Garso](https://www.last.fm/music/Johnny+Garso).

# Reads

I finished Alice Munro [Too much happiness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22024789-demasiada-felicidad), which is likely to be the most depressing short stories collection ever :_).
