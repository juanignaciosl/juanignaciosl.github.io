excerpt: "Notes, slides and code about 99 Bottles of OOP workshop"

At WeCode I made the promise of making a 4-hour workshop of the magnificent
[99 Bottles of OOP book](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/). Today was the
day.

11 people talked about OOP, tradeoffs and best practices during a morning in
[Cylicon Valley](https://cyliconvalley.es/). I facilitated the workshop, based on
Shameless Green solution that
the book build, test-driven. I chose Ruby because the book also did
and by the time I prepared this it was my daily language, but people could
pick whatever they wanted. Here are the slides:

Instead of doing live coding I based the workshop on git diffs. Here's the
[code](https://github.com/juanignaciosl/99bottles-custom). For each step people
had 1-5 minutes, and then I showed the incremental change. That allows me to
focus on the content and goals instead of the code.

I failed miserably with the time. I literally forgot to take into account the
coffee break, so the last half hour had to be compressed into a few minutes.
Sorry about that U_U. In spite of that, feedback was positive (people is very
kind). Maybe next time I can try using Javascript or Java, because nobody there
was used to Ruby, so it's not valuable.

Beer time afterwards was the best thing, though. A lot of many interesting
conversations, ranging from Kotlin to DDD or University. Many thanks to
the attendees!
