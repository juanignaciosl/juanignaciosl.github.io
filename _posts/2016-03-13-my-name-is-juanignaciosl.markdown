GitHub pages seems a nice fit for code-related stuff, so in spite of also having an almost forgotten [personal blog](http://www.juanignaciosl.com) I've just created this one for code-related stuff. I will probably use [Medium](https://medium.com/@juanignaciosl) for random stuff as well. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juanignaciosl) is probably the best place to contact me though.

For a first post, since I'm working at [CartoDB](http://www.cartodb.com) as a Backend Engineer and we're working on [location intelligence](http://blog.cartodb.com/what-is-location-intelligence-and-its-benefits/) tools, a map seems a good fit :)

This morning I imported [some data about worldwide earnings](https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/edition-2015.html) with the [CartoDB Chrome importing extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cartodb/jnldbjiacbadknjdlajdlccmebnlcdlm) and created [a simple map](https://team.cartodb.com/u/juanignaciosl/viz/e94eaba2-e912-11e5-8a32-0e3a376473ab/public_map).
Just a minute later [@matallo](https://twitter.com/matallo) blamed me with a good reason: I hadn't used [Deep Insights](https://cartodb.com/deep-insights/), our brand-new library for creating amazing location intelligence dashboards, so [here it is (fullscreen)](/misc/2016-03-13-bigmac-map/bigmac-map.html)!

Nevertheless, if you want to see a great Deep Insights example, please check his [Visualizing 1M flight routes with CartoDB](http://matall.in/posts/deep-insights-visualizing-1m-flight-routes/) amazing blog post.
