    Felt embeds are available to everybody and I had to check how awesome it would've been for the last conference I helped organizing.

In [Felt](https://felt.com/) we've just released [embed maps](https://twitter.com/felt/status/1542960529467092992) ðŸŽ‰.
This was one of the most requested features after [the launch of our incredibly user-friendly mapping tool](https://felt.com/about) and now you can add your Felt maps to your websites.

I'm obviously biased, but I think that Felt might be the best tool for sharing information on top of maps.
It would've been a great tool for [the last WeCode that was organized](https://wecodefest.com/).

We could've added to [this shared map with software conferences](https://felt.com/map/Software-conferences-68eR49ClbSRSaGwc1hBxXzD) and make WeCode appear to everybody seeing it.

And then zoom in and create another one with the city-level information on venues.

And then zoom in even more and create another one for indoor mapping, rooms...:

No more map screenshooting to explain in which room happens what, everything in the same _place_!
And the day of the conference [you can see your location if you open the map in your phone](https://twitter.com/felt/status/153166657073215x4880).

I've created this in a few minutes. Felt is perfect for this because of many small features:
- Building clipping: you can select buildings (or countries, provinces...) and edit or copy them. I used it for highlighting the venues and also for a parallel indoor map of the second floor of the building.
- Easy image embedding: just paste the screenshot of the agenda.
- Rich embeds: you paste a link, you get a preview of the web.
- Quick drawing tools for rooms, corridors...
- Zoom-aware elements (you can add info that is only relevant at building-size level).
- Sharing and embedding.

I've missed _one_ thing in the process of making this blogpost, but it's in the roadmap ;). Let us know if you miss anything else,
we're eager for feedback!

And [we're hiring!](https://felt.com/careers).
