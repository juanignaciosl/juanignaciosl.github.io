[Rafa Berm√∫dez](https://twitter.com/rafbermudez) shared some months ago [a list of software-related conferences with some data, including price and
date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I52jC0h3usyQjuEiIGLrjXd8kz8FiQUbH8xykMMFfPQ/edit#gid=381678081).

I usually spend my leapfrog time at [CARTO](https://carto.com/) doing some maps. I''m certainly not a cartographer nor
have map skills, but using the [Builder](https://carto.com/builder/) is really fun and, you know, you should use the
tools you make.

Today, as [TarugoConf](http://www.tarugoconf.com/) gets closer, I spent some minutes doing [a
map](https://juanignaciosl.carto.com/builder/fb4b07b8-b401-4b59-9197-7f0f88625e79/embed), based on Rafa
Bermudez data, with conferences.

[You can contribute to the map with this
form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdc3PiOaV1DAQV1QYbifPY6S2_W22DWLdcLAMr-FUyZ_toMWA/viewform) :-)
Underneath all this there's a Google Spreadsheet synced to CARTO, and the map gets updated when it changes, including
automatic geolocation.

Enjoy!
