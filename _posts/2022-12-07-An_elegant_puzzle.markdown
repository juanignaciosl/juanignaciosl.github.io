[I had already read Staff Engineer]({% post_url 2022-07-29-Staff_engineer %}) by [Will Larson](https://lethain.com/), 
and now it's turn for his bestselling
**[An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management](https://press.stripe.com/an-elegant-puzzle)**.

I've enjoyed this book from the first word to the very last. I usually take notes (and dump them here), but in this
case I felt it was pointless: the content is so interesting, concise and dense, that the notes would inflict many
copyright laws :)

Most (all?) of the content is available in [his blog](https://lethain.com/), but the book is compact and well-structured,
it doesn't feel like a collection of blogposts. You can still find the internal consistency of a disciplined writer,
with the same structure at the innermost sections: problem definition, suboptimal approaches (bad experiences, reactions off
the top of your head), approach summary, approach details, final words.

The articles are grouped into *5 major topics*: organizations, tools, approaches, culture and careers.

**Organizations** start with sizing and, most interestingly, [analyzing the state a team is at](https://lethain.com/durably-excellent-teams/):
falling behind, treading water, repaying debt and innovation. He defines each state and provide suggestions on how to
move forward. This is also interesting later, as for example he suggests against hiring in an innovating team. Most
of the rest is about changing organization structure.

The first topic at **tools** section is systems thinking, which is implicitly present through the whole book. It's not
just about drawing fancy diagrams. It's about tools for analyzing and acting. After that _meta_, you'll find tools
for the Engineering Manager toolbox: metrics, controls...

**Approaches** is probably the most heterogeneous chapter, a collection of transversal suggestions, from exceptions at
policies to manager relationships.

**Culture** contains all that slow wisdom that you see when there's time or distance to a company: all those decisions
and approaches that shape teams.

Finally, **careers** encompasses how engineering management impacts the professional life of people, from hiring to
performanced management. This covers from interview detail to new roles definitions.

There's a last **appendix** section with "tools for operating a growing organization" (that I would've placed somewhere
else), books, papers and links.

The book is beautifully edited. I started with the digital version, but I couldn't resist and switched to the paper one.

I can't stop recommending the book (or the blog!). Will Larson has written in a crisp language a huge amount of experience,
backed by precise analysis, and delivered it in terms of specific tools and actions. It's not only about opinions but
about actionable guidelines and frameworks.
