excerpt: Slides and video about the "Continuous Integration at CartoDB" talk.

Last December I talked about Continuous Integration (Continuous Deployment, indeed) at [CAS 2015](http://cas2015.agile-spain.org/). I'd really want to thank Agile Spain for accepting it. They've created an amazing community and I was honored to join their biggest event so far. Here's the video of the event:

This week I've been invited by [Craftsmanship Madrid](https://twitter.com/craftsmanmadrid) to speak about the same topic, thank you very much, guys! I expanded the previous presentation in order to speak about QA, which I overlooked the first time, give a little more detail about tooling and update some already obsolete slides (things change fast at CartoDB). Here are the slides:
